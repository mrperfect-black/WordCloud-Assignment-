Input Text: The script reads text data from a file (text.csv).
Mask Image: The shape of the WordCloud is based on a black-and-white mask image (text.jpg).
WordCloud Generation: The script processes the text and fills the mask shape with words.
Visualization: The WordCloud is displayed using Matplotlib for viewing and saving.
